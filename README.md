Simple interactive pong game for 2, made with turtle.
This was my first time working with the turtle module so I'm sure some things are not very optimal but it was a lot of fun and it encouraged me to begin other projects.

The bars and the ball are created in separate classes (both located in the file pong_items.py) and the collisions and score check is also addressed in there.
